# reStructuredPython 0.6.0

The all in one, new python.
reStructuredPython aka 'rePython' is a version of python with javascript-like syntax for a cleaner, easier to read text that compiles into python. 

To download the reStructuredPython compiler using the python package index:

```shell
pip install --upgrade restructuredpython
```
Download our vscode extension [from the visual studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RihaanMeher.restructuredpython)

To use the reStructuredPython compiler:

```shell
repy path/to/your/file.repy
```
It is that simple!

reStructuredPython code is written in a file extension .repy.
Intellisense features are coming soon!

Differences from python:

Control statements now use curly brackets like this:

```repy
x = int(input('gimme a num'))
if x == 2 {
    print("x is 2!")
    if (input("say 'yes'") == 'yes') {
        print('Hi')
    }
} 
elif x < 2 {
    print("x is less than 2!")
} 
else {
    print("x is greater than 2!")
}

for i in range(10) {
    print(i)
}

def my_function(param) {
    return param
}
```
Compiles into:
```python
x = int(input('gimme a num'))
if x == 2 :
    print("x is 2!")
    if (input("say 'yes'") == 'yes') :
        print('Hi')
    
 
elif x < 2 :
    print("x is less than 2!")
 
else:
    print("x is greater than 2!")


for i in range(10) :
    print(i)


def my_function(param) :
    return param
```
